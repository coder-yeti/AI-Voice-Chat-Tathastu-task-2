# AI-Voice-Chat-Tathastu-task-2
I have created an AI voice chat using Python, it is designed to listen to commands and then execute on preset outputs setup.
This file was created as part of my Python Internship during the Tathastu Scholar Internship Program as part of my task 2. 
I have created this program with help of youtube tutorial created by Mr. Achintya Gaumat of TwoWaits as part of a free python project workshop.
